        A strings literals can be specified in four diffrent way :-

        -> single quotes.
        -> double quotes.
        -> heredoc syntax.
        -> newdoc syntax.

/*
        Single quotes :-
                        single quotes don't consider any variable just print straight forword.
        Ex. 
            $x = 5;
            echo 'The number is $x';
                                        Output:- The number is $x.

    */

/*
        double quotes :-
                        double quotes consider varibles and put that value with the strings.
        Ex.
            $x = 5;
            echo "The number is $x ;
                                        Output:- The number is 5.
    
        Note :- 
                -> escaped character start with backslash(\);
                -> escape character are many like \t(tab), \n(new line), etc.
                -> confusing escape character is \f (form feed).
                -> Most interesting escape character is \ooo(Octal value convert into string)
                    and \xhh(hex value convert into string).
